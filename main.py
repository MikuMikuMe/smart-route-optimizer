Certainly! Developing a Smart Route Optimizer involves quite a bit of complexity, particularly when dealing with real-time traffic data and dynamically adjusting routes. Below is an illustrative Python program that demonstrates a basic structure for such a system. This example assumes access to a traffic data API (like Google Maps or Mapbox) and performs route optimization. Due to the limitations of this text-based interface, I will simulate data responses and simplify certain aspects.

Note: To run a real-world application, you'll need valid API keys and more sophisticated data handling.

```python
import requests
import datetime

# Constants
API_KEY = 'your_api_key_here'  # Replace with your actual API key for a traffic data provider

# Function to fetch route data from a mock API
def fetch_route_data(start, end):
    # Simulated data. Replace this with an actual API call.
    try:
        response = requests.get(
            f'http://api.traffic.mock/route', 
            params={'start': start, 'end': end, 'key': API_KEY}
        )
        response.raise_for_status()
        return response.json()
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        print(f"An error occurred while fetching route data: {e}")
        return None

# Function that processes route data and suggests an optimal route
def optimize_route(route_data):
    try:
        if not route_data:
            raise ValueError(f"No route data provided")

        # Let's assume route_data contains distance and estimated time
        best_route = min(route_data, key=lambda x: x['duration'])
        return best_route
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred while optimizing the route: {e}")
        return None

# Main function to demonstrate usage
def main():
    start_location = "123 Main St, Anytown"
    end_location = "456 Elm St, Othertown"

    print(f"Fetching route data for {start_location} to {end_location}")
    route_data = fetch_route_data(start_location, end_location)
    if not route_data:
        print("Failed to fetch route data.")
        return

    print("Optimizing route...")
    best_route = optimize_route(route_data)
    if not best_route:
        print("Failed to find an optimal route.")
        return

    # Display the results
    print(f"Optimal Route Found:")
    print(f"Start: {best_route['start']}")
    print(f"End: {best_route['end']}")
    print(f"Duration: {best_route['duration']} minutes")
    print(f"Distance: {best_route['distance']} km")

# Run the main function
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

### Key Points:
- **API Integration**: Here we've used a mock URL, you should replace it with the actual traffic data provider's endpoint.
- **Error Handling**: Exceptions are handled to cover issues during API calls and processing.
- **Optimization Logic**: The code attempts to select the route with the shortest duration. This can be extended to include other factors like road conditions, fuel efficiency, etc.
- **API Key Management**: API keys should be secret. In real applications, consider environment variables or a secure configuration management tool.

Make sure to install any necessary packages using pip (e.g., `requests`) and replace placeholders with your real-world data and logic for fetching and processing traffic and route data.
